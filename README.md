# 1. Learning Crib Sheet

A drop zone for links and materials around topics I would like to delve into (or am actively looking out through work/play).

- [1. Learning Crib Sheet](#1-learning-crib-sheet)
  - [1.1. Introduction](#11-introduction)

## 1.1. Introduction

Each section will denote a subject that I am actively trying to investigate, covering topics required for work and for personal blogging. This document will adjust over time as I cover topics in as much detail as required (at the given time).
